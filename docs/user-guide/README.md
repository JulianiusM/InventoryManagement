## Understanding Permissions

Surveyor uses a fine-grained permission system with two levels:

- **Group Permissions** - Apply to audiences (participant, guest, authenticated, public)
- **Individual Permissions** - Apply to specific users (administrators)

Each level can have permissions like VIEW, EDIT, MANAGE_ASSIGNMENTS, ITEM_ADD, etc.

**See the [Permissions Guide](PERMISSIONS.md) for complete details on the permission system.**
